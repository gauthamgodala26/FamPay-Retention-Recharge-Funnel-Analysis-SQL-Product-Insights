## SQL Queries (Task 1)

### Metric 1: Average Transactions per Month (Retained vs Not Retained)

```sql
WITH cte AS (
    SELECT
        user_id,
        CASE WHEN COUNT(DISTINCT date_trunc('month', date_of_transaction)) >= 3
             THEN 'Retained' ELSE 'Not Retained' END AS retention_status,
        COUNT(*) AS txn_count
    FROM transaction_details
    WHERE status = 'Completed'
    GROUP BY user_id
)

SELECT
    retention_status,
    ROUND(AVG(txn_count), 2) AS avg_transactions
FROM cte
GROUP BY retention_status;

```

             THEN 'Retained' ELSE 'Not Retained' END AS retention_status,
        MIN(t.date_of_transaction) - u.activation_date AS days_to_first_txn
    FROM transaction_details t
    INNER JOIN user_details u ON t.user_id = u.user_id
    WHERE t.status = 'Completed'
    GROUP BY u.user_id

SELECT
    cte.retention_status,
    t.type_of_transaction,
    COUNT(*) AS txn_count,
    CONCAT(
        ROUND(
            100.0 * COUNT(*) /
            SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER (PARTITION BY cte.retention_status), 2
        ),
        '%'
    ) AS percentage_share
FROM transaction_details t
INNER JOIN cte ON t.user_id = cte.user_id
WHERE t.status = 'Completed'
GROUP BY cte.retention_status, t.type_of_transaction
ORDER BY txn_count DESC;
```
### METRIC 4: Avg, Min, Max transaction value
```sql
WITH cte AS (
    SELECT
        user_id,
        CASE WHEN COUNT(DISTINCT date_trunc('month', date_of_transaction)) >= 3
             THEN 'Retained' ELSE 'Not Retained' END AS retention_status
    FROM transaction_details
    WHERE status = 'Completed'
    GROUP BY user_id
)

SELECT
    cte.retention_status,
    AVG(t.amount) AS avg_txn_value,
    MAX(t.amount) AS max_txn_value,
    MIN(t.amount) AS min_txn_value
FROM transaction_details t
INNER JOIN cte ON t.user_id = cte.user_id
WHERE t.status = 'Completed'
GROUP BY cte.retention_status;
```
### METRIC 5: Age group distribution (Teens, Young Adults, Adults)
```sql
WITH cte AS (
    SELECT
        user_id,
        CASE WHEN COUNT(DISTINCT date_trunc('month', date_of_transaction)) >= 3
             THEN 'Retained' ELSE 'Not Retained' END AS retention_status
    FROM transaction_details
    WHERE status = 'Completed'
    GROUP BY user_id
)

SELECT
    cte.retention_status,
    CASE
        WHEN u.age BETWEEN 13 AND 17 THEN 'Teen(13-17)'
        WHEN u.age BETWEEN 18 AND 21 THEN 'Young Adult(18-21)'
        WHEN u.age BETWEEN 22 AND 25 THEN 'Adult(22-25)'
        ELSE 'Other'
    END AS age_distribution,
    COUNT(*) AS users
FROM user_details u
INNER JOIN cte ON u.user_id = cte.user_id
GROUP BY cte.retention_status, age_distribution
ORDER BY cte.retention_status, users DESC;
```

### METRIC 6: Average active months (Retained vs Non Retained)
```sql
WITH active_months AS (
    SELECT
        user_id,
        COUNT(DISTINCT date_trunc('month', date_of_transaction)) AS active_months
    FROM transaction_details
    WHERE status = 'Completed'
    GROUP BY user_id
),

retention_status AS (
    SELECT
        user_id,
        CASE WHEN COUNT(DISTINCT date_trunc('month', date_of_transaction)) >= 3
             THEN 'Retained' ELSE 'Not Retained' END AS retention_status
    FROM transaction_details
    WHERE status = 'Completed'
    GROUP BY user_id
)

SELECT
    rs.retention_status,
    AVG(am.active_months) AS avg_active_months
FROM retention_status rs
INNER JOIN active_months am ON rs.user_id = am.user_id
GROUP BY rs.retention_status;
```
### METRIC 7: Transaction type diversity (Single vs Multi-type users)
```sql
WITH retention_status AS (
    SELECT
        user_id,
        CASE WHEN COUNT(DISTINCT date_trunc('month', date_of_transaction)) >= 3
             THEN 'Retained' ELSE 'Not Retained' END AS retention_status
    FROM transaction_details
    WHERE status = 'Completed'
    GROUP BY user_id
),

txn_type AS (
    SELECT
        user_id,
        COUNT(DISTINCT type_of_transaction) AS txn_type_count
    FROM transaction_details
    WHERE status = 'Completed'
    GROUP BY user_id
)

SELECT
    rs.retention_status,
    SUM(CASE WHEN t.txn_type_count >= 2 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS multiple_users,
    COUNT(*) AS total_users,
    CONCAT(
        ROUND(
            100.0 *
            SUM(CASE WHEN t.txn_type_count >= 2 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) /
            COUNT(*),
        2),
        '%'
    ) AS percentage_of_multipletype_users
FROM retention_status rs
INNER JOIN txn_type t ON rs.user_id = t.user_id
GROUP BY rs.retention_status;
```
